# MAE273B
Robust Controller Design For Quadrotors

Running the controller scripts (lqrscripts, hinfscripts, lqgscripts, youlascripts) file could save the gains into corresponding mat file, besides, there would be additional system analysis plots.

Uncomment the gains at the bottom of the param.m file to choose the controller gains.

Modifying the initial conditions and the winds in param.m file to change the conditions in simulation.

Modifying the disired states in UAV_CL.slx to change the reference inputs.

Run the simulation in UAV_CL.slx to check the results.
